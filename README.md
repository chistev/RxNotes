## RxNotes: A Note-Taking Web Application for Pharmacists

In response to the observed gap in some pharmacists' ability to discuss drugs beyond basic dispensing, I developed **RxNotes**, a simple note web application designed to share summarized drug information tailored for pharmacists. This platform allows users to search for specific drugs and quickly access concise information about their mechanisms of action (MOA). The application aims to expand its database in the coming days to provide more comprehensive resources. This project serves as my contribution to the pharmacy profession, and I welcome suggestions for improvement and collaboration from fellow pharmacists and developers.

You can explore the application at [chistev.pythonanywhere.com](https://chistev.pythonanywhere.com). Built using Django and HTMX, **RxNotes** ensures a seamless user experience for those seeking to enhance their pharmaceutical knowledge.
